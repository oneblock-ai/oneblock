# 1Block.AI [WIP]

An open-source, cloud-native LLMOps platform for LLMs and generative AI applications management.

> WARNING: 1Block.AI is a work in progress. Features will evolve over time and there may be breaking changes between releases. Please refrain from using it for any production purposes for now!

## Description
1Block.AI is an open-source, cloud-native LLMOps platform that aims to empower your innovation in LLMs and generative AI applications. It is built on top of cutting-edge technologies such as Kubernetes, Ray.io, LangChain, etc., and designed to be cloud-agnostic and ML framework agnostic.

Below are the key features of the 1Block.AI:

1. [x] **Easy Installation:** [1Block.AI](http://1block.ai) can be directly installed on any Kubernetes cluster, offering an out-of-the-box user experience.
1. [ ] **Complete LLM Lifecycle Management:** Provides a unified interface for both developers and non-developers to manage the entire life cycle of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI applications.
1. [ ] **Multi-model Support:** Integrates seamlessly with popular LLM models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-2, ChatGLM, etc.). Allows iterative upload, tracking, and management of custom model versions, associating them with specific datasets and hyperparameters.
1. [ ] **Multi-cloud Compatibility:** Supports deploying your LLM and AI applications to various clouds, including AWS, GCP, Aliyun, Azure, etc., as well as on-premise environments.
1. [ ] **Built-in Multi-tenant & Multi-cluster Support:** Utilizes RBAC policies for built-in multi-tenant support, enabling users to manage resources across multiple clusters.
1. [ ] **Effortless Deployment & Monitoring:** One-click deployment of AI applications to different clouds with auto-scaling capabilities (serverless). Ensures easy monitoring of your applications by tracking traffic, inference, and resource usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Helm v3.0.0+
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.23+ cluster.

### Installation
To deploy the 1Block.AI on your k8s cluster, you can use the following commands:

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
$ make install
```
or
```sh
$ helm upgrade --install --create-namepsace -n oneblock-system oneblock-crd ./deploy/charts/oneblock-crd
```

**Deploy the api-server to the cluster:**

```sh
$ make deploy
```
or
```sh
$ helm upgrade --install --create-namespace -n oneblock-system oneblock ./deploy/charts/oneblock
```

### Uninstall
**Delete the CRDs and api-server from the cluster:**

```sh
$ helm uninstall -n oneblock-system oneblock-crd
$ helm uninstall -n oneblock-system oneblock
```
or
```sh
$ make uninstall && make undeploy
```
